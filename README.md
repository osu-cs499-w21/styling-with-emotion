# Styling Components with Emotion

This code will serve as our starting point for using Emotion to style components in a React app.  The first time you run this app, make sure to run `npm install` first, to install needed dependencies.  Then, to run the app and see it in your browser, you can run
```
npm start
```
This will run the app in the development mode, and it should automatically open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app in your browser (though you can manually open that URL in your browser, too).  The app is set up so that the page will reload if you make edits to the code.  You will also see any lint errors in the console.
